# Gabedit

Gabedit is a free graphical user interface for computational chemistry packages.

Gabedit makes using Computational Chemistry Packages (CCP) simple and straightforward :

 * Sketch in molecules using its advanced 3D Structure Builder, or load in molecules from standard files. 
 * Set up and submit CCP jobs right from the interface, and monitor their progress as they run. 
 * Examine calculation results graphically via state-of-the-art visualization features: display molecular orbitals and other surfaces, view spectra, animate normal modes, geometry optimizations and reaction paths. 
 * Simulated Annealing/Conformational search with Molecular Dynamics is implemented in Gabedit using Amber 99 molecular mechanics or Semi-Empirical potentials.

The computational chemistry packages supported by Gabedit are : [Gamess-US](http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/GAMESS/), [Gaussian](http://www.gaussian.com/), [Molcas](http://www.teokem.lu.se/molcas/), [Molpro](http://www.molpro.net/), [MPQC](http://www.mpqc.org/), [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/), [OpenMopac](http://www.openmopac.net/), [Orca](http://www.thch.uni-bonn.de/tc/orca/), [FireFly](http://classic.chem.msu.su/gran/gamess/index.html) and [Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com/). [ADF](http://www.scm.com/), [ErgoSCF](http://www.ergoscf.org/) and other software (through the gabedit and molden format files) are partially supported by Gabedit.
